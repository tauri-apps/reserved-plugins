# Reserved Tauri Plugins

These are plugins with reserved names that are registered by us to prevent intentional or unintentional confusion.
Currently only two names are reserved, `core` and `tauri`. This is to reserve an officially named plugin for some unspecified future use, and the `core` plugin is reserved due to being used as a namespace for built-in plugins inside the [`tauri`] crate.
See the [plugin documentation] for developing your own plugins.

[`tauri`]: https://crates.io/crates/tauri
